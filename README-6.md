This project aims to create an efficient system that can automatically detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or videos. Using computer vision and advanced technologies like machine learning or deep learning, the system identifies license plates, reads the characters, and converts them into text. It has practical applications in areas like traffic monitoring, automated toll booths, parking systems, and law enforcement, making processes faster and more accurate.
